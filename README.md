# Skyrim-Mods

This is an archive of all Skyrim mods I have made, they're licensed under CC-BY 3.0 *(they contain mostly visual files)* and you're free to use or edit them. Please consider not uploading them to Nexus Mods, this archive was made as an alternative to hosting them there.

Each mod has an installation instruction file included.
